- rawdog 1.3

Reverted the "retry immediately" behaviour from 1.2, since it causes denied or
broken feeds to get checked every time rawdog is run.

- rawdog 1.2

Updated feedparser to 2.5.2, which fixes a bug that was making rawdog
handle content incorrectly in Echo feeds, handles more content encoding
methods, and returns HTTP status codes. (I've applied a small patch to
correct handling of some Echo feeds.)

Added useful messages for different HTTP status codes and HTTP timeouts.
Since rawdog reads a config file, it can't automatically update
redirected feeds, but it will now tell you about them.  Note that for
"fatal" errors (anything except a 2xx response or a redirect), rawdog
will now retry the feed next time it's run.

Prefer "content" over "content_encoded", and fall back correctly if no
useful "content" is found.

- rawdog 1.1

rawdog now preserves the ordering of articles in the RSS when a group of
articles are added at the same time.

Updated rawdog URL in setup.py, since it now has a web page.

Updated rssparser to feedparser 2.4, and added very preliminary support
for the "content" element it can return (for Echo feeds).

- rawdog 1.0

Initial stable release.
