- rawdog 1.1

rawdog now preserves the ordering of articles in the RSS when a group of
articles are added at the same time.

Updated rawdog URL in setup.py, since it now has a web page.

Updated rssparser to feedparser 2.4, and added very preliminary support
for the "content" element it can return (for Echo feeds).

- rawdog 1.0

Initial stable release.
