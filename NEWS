- rawdog 1.3

Reverted the "retry immediately" behaviour from 1.2, since it causes
denied or broken feeds to get checked every time rawdog is run.

Updated feedparser to 2.5.3, which now returns the XML encoding used.
rawdog uses this information to convert all incoming items into UTF-8,
so multiple encodings are now handled correctly (and the HTML output is
now encoded in UTF-8 rather than ISO-8859-1 as before).

Use standard option syntax (i.e. "--update --write" instead of "update
write").  The old syntax will be supported until 2.0.

Error output from reading the config file and from --update now goes to
stderr instead of stdout.

Made the socket timeout configurable (which also means the included copy
of feedparser isn't modified any more).

Added --config option to read an additional config file; this lets you
have multiple output files with different options.

- rawdog 1.2

Updated feedparser to 2.5.2, which fixes a bug that was making rawdog
handle content incorrectly in Echo feeds, handles more content encoding
methods, and returns HTTP status codes. (I've applied a small patch to
correct handling of some Echo feeds.)

Added useful messages for different HTTP status codes and HTTP timeouts.
Since rawdog reads a config file, it can't automatically update
redirected feeds, but it will now tell you about them.  Note that for
"fatal" errors (anything except a 2xx response or a redirect), rawdog
will now retry the feed next time it's run.

Prefer "content" over "content_encoded", and fall back correctly if no
useful "content" is found.

- rawdog 1.1

rawdog now preserves the ordering of articles in the RSS when a group of
articles are added at the same time.

Updated rawdog URL in setup.py, since it now has a web page.

Updated rssparser to feedparser 2.4, and added very preliminary support
for the "content" element it can return (for Echo feeds).

- rawdog 1.0

Initial stable release.
