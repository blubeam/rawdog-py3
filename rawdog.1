.TH RAWDOG 1
.SH NAME
rawdog \- an RSS Aggregator Without Delusions Of Grandeur
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rawdog
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrawdog\fP is a feed aggregator for Unix-like systems.
.PP
\fBrawdog\fP uses the Python \fBfeedparser\fP module to retrieve
articles from a number of feeds in RSS, Atom and other formats, and
writes out a single HTML file, based on a template either provided by
the user or generated by \fBrawdog\fP, containing the latest articles
it's seen.
.PP
\fBrawdog\fP uses the ETags and Last-Modified headers to avoid fetching
a file that hasn't changed, and supports gzip and delta compression to
reduce bandwidth when it has. \fBrawdog\fP is configured from a simple
text file; the only state kept between invocations that can't be
reconstructed from the feeds is the ordering of articles.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`\-'). A summary of options is
included below. For a complete description, see the README file.
.SS General Options
.TP
.BI \-d \ DIR\fP, \ \-\-dir \ DIR
Use
.I DIR
instead of the $HOME/.rawdog directory.
This option lets you have two or more \fBrawdog\fP setups with different
configurations and sets of feeds.
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-no\-locking
Do not lock the state file.
.IP ""
\fBrawdog\fP usually claims a lock on its state file, to stop more than
one instance from running at the same time. Unfortunately, some
filesystems don't support file locking; you can use this option to
disable locking entirely if you're in that situation.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Print more detailed information about what \fBrawdog\fP is doing while
it runs.
.TP
.B \-W, \-\-no\-lock\-wait
Exit silently if the state file is already locked.
.IP ""
If the state file is already locked, \fBrawdog\fP will normally wait
until it becomes available, then run. However, if you're got a lot of
feeds and a slow network connection, you might prefer \fBrawdog\fP to
just give up immediately if the previous instance is still running.
.SS Actions
\fBrawdog\fP will perform these actions in the order given.
.TP
.BI \-a \ URL\fP, \ \-\-add \ URL
Try to find a feed associated with
.I URL
and add it to the config file.
.IP ""
.I URL
may be a feed itself, or it can be an HTML page that links to a feed in
any of a variety of ways. \fBrawdog\fP uses heuristics to pick the best
feed it can find, and will complain if it can't find one.
.TP
.BI \-c \ FILE\fP, \ \-\-config \ FILE
Read
.I FILE
as an additional config file; any options provided in
.I FILE
will override those set in the main config file (with the exception of
"feed", which is cumulative).
.I FILE
may be an absolute path or a path relative to your .rawdog directory.
.IP ""
Note that $HOME/.rawdog/config will still be read first even if you
specify this option. \fB\-c\fP is mostly useful when you want to write
the same set of feeds out using two different sets of output options.
.TP
.BI \-f \ URL\fP, \ \-\-update\-feed \ URL
Update the feed pointed to by
.I URL
immediately, even if its period hasn't elapsed since it was last
updated. This is useful when you're publishing a feed yourself, and want
to test whether it's working properly.
.TP
.B \-l, \ \-\-list
List brief information about each of the feeds that was known about at
the time of the last update.
.TP
.BI \-r \ URL\fP, \ \-\-remove \ URL
Remove feed
.I URL
from the config file.
.TP
.B \-t, \ \-\-show\-template
Print the page template currently in use to stdout. This can be used as
a starting point if you want to design your own template for use with
the \fBtemplate\fP option in the config file.
.TP
.B \-T, \ \-\-show\-itemtemplate
Print the item template currently in use to stdout.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-update
Fetch data from the feeds and store it. This could take some time if
you've got lots of feeds.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-write
Write out the HTML output file.
.SS Special Actions
If one of these options is specified, \fBrawdog\fP will perform only
that action, then exit.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Provide a brief summary of all the options \fBrawdog\fP supports.
.SH EXAMPLES
\fBrawdog\fP is typically invoked from
.BR cron (1).
The following
.BR crontab (5)
entry would fetch data from feeds and write it to HTML once an hour,
exiting if \fBrawdog\fP is already running:
.PP
.nf
.RS
0 * * * *  rawdog -Wuw
.RE
.fi
.SH FILES
$HOME/.rawdog/config
