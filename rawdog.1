.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly documents the

command.
.PP
\fBrawdog\fP is an RSS (and other) feed aggregator, based on Mark
Pilgrim's flexible feed parser. \fBrawdog\fP reads articles from a
number of feeds and writes out a single HTML file, based on a template
either provided by the user or generated by rawdog, containing the
latest articles it's seen.
