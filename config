# The format to write day headings in. (See "man strftime" if you want to

# The file that rawdog will store its internal state in. Most users

# The template file to use, or "default" to use the built-in template
# (which is probably sufficient for most users). Use "rawdog -t" to show
# the template currently in use as a starting-point for customisation.
# The following strings will be replaced in the output:
# __version__         The rawdog version in use
# __refresh__         The HTML 4 <meta http-equiv="refresh" ...> header
# __items__           The aggregated items
# __feeds__           The listing of feeds
# Note that rawdog's output is always in the UTF-8 encoding, so you should
# preserve the <meta http-equiv="Content-type" ...> header from the default
# template when building your own.

# Where to write the output HTML to. You should place style.css in the same
# directory. Specify this as "-" to write the HTML to stdout.

# Whether to use (1) or not use (0) a <meta http-equiv="Refresh" ...> tag
# in the generated HTML to indicate that the page should be refreshed
# automatically. If this is turned on, then the page will refresh every N
# minutes, where N is the shortest feed period value specified below.
# (This works by controlling whether the default template includes
# __refresh__; if you use a custom template, __refresh__ is always
# available.)

# Whether to show the list of active feeds in the generated HTML.

# The time in seconds that rawdog will wait before considering a feed
# unreachable when trying to connect. If you're getting lots of timeout
# errors and are on a slow connection, increase this.
timeout 30

# The feeds you want to watch, in the format "feed period url".
# The period is the minimum time in minutes between updates; if less
# than period minutes have passed, "rawdog update" will skip that feed.
# Specifying a period less than 30 minutes is considered to be bad manners; it
# is suggested that you make the period as long as possible.
# You can specify as many feeds as you like.
