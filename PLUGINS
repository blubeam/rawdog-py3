# Writing rawdog plugins

## Introduction

As provided, rawdog provides a fairly small set of features. In order to
make it do more complex jobs, rawdog can be extended using plugin
modules written in Python. This document is intended for developers who
want to extend rawdog by writing plugins.

Extensions work by registering hook functions which are called by
various bits of rawdog's core as it runs. These functions can modify
rawdog's internal state in various interesting ways. An arbitrary number
of functions can be attached to each hook; they are called in the order
they were attached. Hook functions take various arguments depending on
where they're called from, and returns a boolean value indicating
whether further functions attached to the same hook should be called.

The "plugindirs" config option gives a list of directories to search for
plugins; all Python modules found in those directories will be loaded by
rawdog. In practice, this means that you need to call your file
something ending in ".py" to have it recognised as a plugin.

## The plugins module

All plugins should import the `rawdoglib.plugins` module, which provides
the functions for registering and calling hooks, along with some
utilities for plugins. Many plugins will also want to import the
`rawdoglib.rawdog` module, which contains rawdog's core functionality,
much of which is reusable.

### rawdoglib.plugins.attach_hook(hook_name, function)

The attach_hook function adds a hook function to the hook of the given
name.

### rawdoglib.plugins.Box

The Box class is used to pass immutable types by reference to hook
functions; this allows several plugins to modify a value. It contains a
single `value` attribute for the value it is holding.

## Hooks

Most hook functions are called with "rawdog" and "config" as their first
two arguments; these are references to the aggregator's Rawdog and
Config objects.

If you need a hook that doesn't currently exist, please contact me.

The following hooks are supported:

### startup(rawdog, config)

Run when rawdog starts up, after the state file and config file have
been loaded, but before rawdog starts processing command-line arguments.

### shutdown(rawdog, config)

Run just before rawdog saves the state file and exits.

### config_option(config, name, value)

* name: the option name
* value: the option value

Called when rawdog encounters a config file option that it doesn't
recognise. The rawdoglib.rawdog.parse_* functions will probably be
useful when dealing with config options. You can raise ValueError to
have rawdog print an appropriate error message.  You should return False
from this hook if name is an option you recognise.

Note that using config.log in this hook will probably not do what you
want, because the verbose flag may not yet have been turned on.

### config_option_arglines(config, name, value, arglines)

* name: the option name
* value: the option value
* arglines: a list of extra indented lines given after the option (which
  can be used to supply extra arguments for the option)

As config_option for options that can handle extra argument lines.
If the options you are implementing should not have extra arguments,
then use the config_option hook instead.

### output_filter(rawdog, config, articles)

* articles: the mutable list of Article objects

Called before rawdog sorts the list of articles to write. This hook can
be used to remove articles that shouldn't be written.

### output_sort(rawdog, config, articles)

* articles: the mutable list of Article objects

Called after rawdog has sorted the list of articles to write. This hook
can be used to reorder (or completely resort) the list of articles to
write.

### output_write(rawdog, config, articles)

* articles: the mutable list of Article objects

Called just before rawdog starts writing the HTML output. This hook can
be used to implement alternative output methods.

### output_items_begin(rawdog, config, f)

* f: a writable file object (__items__)

Called before rawdog starts expanding the items template. This set of
hooks can be used to implement alternative date (or other section)
headings.

### output_items_heading(rawdog, config, f, article, date)

* f: a writable file object (__items__)
* article: the Article object about to be written
* date: the Article's date for sorting purposes

Called before each item is written.

### output_items_end(rawdog, config, f)

* f: a writable file object (__items__)

Called after all items are written.

### output_bits(rawdog, config, bits)

* bits: a dictionary of template parameters

Called before expanding the main template. This hook can be used to add
extra template parameters.

### output_item_bits(rawdog, config, feed, article, bits)

* feed: the Feed containing this article
* article: the Article being templated
* bits: a dictionary of template parameters

Called before expanding the item template for an article. This hook can
be used to add extra template parameters.

### pre_update_feed(rawdog, config, feed)

* feed: the Feed about to be updated

Called before a feed is updated. This hook can be used to perform extra
actions before fetching a feed.

### input_filter(rawdog, config, article, ignore)

* article: the Article that has been received
* ignore: a Boxed boolean indicating whether to ignore the article

Called when an article is received from a feed. This hook can be used to
modify or ignore incoming articles.

### article_updated(rawdog, config, article, now)

* article: the Article that has been updated
* now: the current time

Called after an article has been updated (when rawdog receives an
article from a feed that it already has).

### article_added(rawdog, config, article, now)

* article: the Article that has been added
* now: the current time

Called after a new article has been added.

### article_expired(rawdog, config, article, now)

* article: the Article that will be expired
* now: the current time

Called before an article is expired.

### fill_template(template, bits, result)

* template: the template string to fill
* bits: a dictionary of template arguments
* result: a Boxed Unicode string for the result of template expansion

Called whenever template expansion is performed. If you set the value
inside result to something other than None, then rawdog will treat that
value as the result of template expansion (rather than performing its
normal expansion process); you can thus use this hook either for
manipulating template parameters, or for replacing the template system
entirely.

### clean_html(config, html, baseurl, inline)

* html: a Boxed Unicode string containing the HTML being cleaned
* baseurl: the URL at which the HTML was originally found
* inline: a boolean indicating whether the output should be inline HTML
  or a block element

Called whenever HTML is being sanitised by rawdog (after its existing
HTML sanitisation processes). You can use this to implement extra
sanitisation passes. You'll need to update the boxed value with the new,
cleaned string.

### add_urllib2_handlers(rawdog, config, feed, handlers)

* feed: the Feed to which the request will be made
* handlers: the mutable list of urllib2 *Handler objects that will be
  passed to feedparser

Called before feedparser is used to fetch feed content. This hook can be
used to add additional urllib2 handlers to cope with unusual protocol
requirements; use `handlers.append` to add extra handlers.

## Examples

### backwards.py

This is probably the simplest useful example plugin: it reverses the
sort order of the output.

	import rawdoglib.plugins
	
	def backwards(rawdog, config, articles):
		articles.reverse()
		return False
	
	rawdoglib.plugins.attach_hook("output_sort", backwards)

### option.py

This plugin shows how to handle a config file option.

	import rawdoglib.plugins
	
	def option(config, name, value):
		if name == "myoption":
			print "Test plugin option:", value
			return False
		else:
			return True
	rawdoglib.plugins.attach_hook("config_option", option)
