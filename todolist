Plugin hook to allow the articles list to be sorted again after filtering -- so
you can filter out duplicates then sort by originally-published date.

Option to do duplicate removal by more sensible article hashing: use a
namespace for hashes where it could be hash:existing-hash or
uid:uid-from-article (detecting articles that are already present).

gzip the state file.

Optionally use a better backend: a real transactional database rather than a
huge file and pickle.
An alternative approach would be to keep a second lightweight cache of 
articles that rawdog knows it's already seen -- it would only need to 
store hashes (or article guids) rather than the full articles.
Or could use fuzzy comparison against previous articles in the same feed -- do
this as a plugin.

Daemon mode -- keep a pidfile, and check the mtime of the state file to avoid
having to reread it.

Option to quit if flocked
Option to limit update runtime

Somewhere safe for plugins to persist data...

--change-feed-url option to change feed URL without losing articles

Look at Expires header to automatically select "periods"

FIXME: redo sorting hack in feedparser.

- Longer-term future: split features out to plugins
  - refresh header
  - HTML4 output
  - removing duplicate articles
  - DayWriter
  - mx.Tidy
  - proxy auth
  - per-feed proxies
  - length limiting in templates
  - mx.Tidy flag to output xhtml
  - nuke future pubDates (Rick van Rein)
- And new features to write as plugins
  - sort by feeds first (should work since sort is stable)

- Article numbering (probably not)

- Ctrl-C shouldn't print the "error loading" warning.

If rawdog crashes while updating a feed, it shouldn't forget the feeds it's
already updated. Perhaps have an exception handler that keeps a safety copy of
the state file and saves where it's got to so far?

Improve efficiency -- memoise stuff before comparing articles.

__comments__ from the feed (and anything else worth having?).

Option to choose whether full content or summary is preferred.

Review expiry logic: is maxage=0 the same as currentonly?

Plugin that gets run on new articles.

OPML listing -- needs feed type.
Do for now as separate program once config parser separate.

Error reporting as feed (or as separate display?) (Dorward)

Feed schedule spreading.

Timeouts should be ignored unless it's been getting timeouts for more than a
configurable amount of time.

Add a needs_update() method to Feed; make Rawdog call that on all the feeds
(when not being forced) and then call update() on each of them that needs it.

For rawdog 3:
- generalise templating (so the show template option takes a name, etc.)
- require Python 2.3
  - use unicode.encode('ascii','xmlcharrefreplace') if possible?
  - "for line in file"
  - "item in dict"
- include author in article hash

Abandoned:
- __feednumber_mod_N__ (for easier default styles, i.e. _mod_4 counts 0-3,0-3)
  (didn't really work for lots of feeds)
